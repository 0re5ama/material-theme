  // This file is a filesystem-level solution for specifying dependencies
  // for packages. This is most useful for package developers since they are
  // not installing their own packages from a repository or channel, and
  // need to make sure Package Control installs the dependencies they need.

  // The file contains two levels of selectors, platform and Sublime Text
  // version, to pick what set of dependencies should be installed.
  // The most-specific selectors will be used, and all other ignored. This
  // means that some dependencies will be duplicated under a specific
  // platform and under *.


  // Matching of platform and version selectors is exclusive. Thus, these
  // dependencies will only be installed if no other keys matched first.
